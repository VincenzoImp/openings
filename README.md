## 📊 Output Files

The tool generates timestamped files in the `results/` directory:

- **all_jobs_[timestamp].xlsx**: Excel format with formatting
- **relevant_jobs_[timestamp].csv**: Filtered highly relevant jobs
- **relevant_jobs_[timestamp].xlsx**: Excel format

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Search Queries

Edit `scripts/search_jobs.py`, lines 19-76 to adjust the search queries. The current queries are tailored to Vincenzo's research areas and technical skills:

```python
search_queries = [
    # Core Research Areas
    "distributed systems researcher",
    "blockchain researcher",
    # ... add your custom queries
]
```

### Adjust Relevance Scoring

Edit the `calculate_relevance_score()` function in `scripts/search_jobs.py` (lines 175-239) to adjust weights. Current weights prioritize:
- Blockchain/distributed systems (+20)
- PhD/research positions (+18)
- Data analysis (+15)

```python
# Example: Increase blockchain weight
if any(keyword in text for keyword in blockchain_keywords):
    score += 25  # Changed from 20
```

### Filter by Specific Companies

Edit `scripts/analyze_jobs.py`:

```python
target_companies = ['Google', 'ETH Zurich', 'EPFL', 'IBM Research']
export_filtered_by_company(df, target_companies)
```

## 📈 Analysis Features

Run `python analyze_jobs.py` to get:

- **Top Companies Hiring**: Most active recruiters
- **Job Locations**: Geographic distribution
- **Common Keywords**: Trending skills and technologies
- **Salary Information**: If available
- **Job Types**: Full-time, contract, internship breakdown
- **Remote Opportunities**: On-site vs remote distribution

## 🌐 Data Sources

The tool scrapes jobs from:
- LinkedIn
- Indeed
- Glassdoor
- Google Jobs

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: JobSpy may hit rate limits on job sites. If you encounter issues:
   - Reduce `results_wanted` parameter (default: 50)
   - Increase delay between searches
   - Run searches at different times

2. **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.10+ (use Docker if you have Python 3.9 or lower)

3. **Results Freshness**: Default search looks at jobs posted in the last 30 days (`hours_old=720`)

4. **Duplicates**: The tool automatically removes duplicate listings based on title, company, and location

## 🔄 Running Periodic Searches

### Using Cron (Linux/Mac)

```bash
# Run daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/switzerland-jobs-search && docker-compose up
```

### Manual Scheduling

Run the script manually whenever you want to check for new positions.
