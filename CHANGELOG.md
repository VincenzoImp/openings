## [Unreleased]

No changes yet.

## [10.3.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- An unbounded export (`limit=0`, added in 10.3.0) stopped at the first page for any set larger than the query cap. `query_jobs` caps a single page at 1000 rows so no one request can materialize an unbounded result set, and the export resolved its limit against that capped query: asking for all 2,256 matching jobs returned 1,000 and reported `total: 2256`, which was correct but easy to read as a complete export. The export now pages internally until it has covered the reported total.

### Changed

- The per-query row cap is now the named constant `JobDatabase.MAX_QUERY_LIMIT` instead of a literal repeated at two call sites, so the export paging and the cap cannot drift apart.

## [10.3.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- `export_jobs` no longer discards the caller's `limit` and `offset`. The application service overwrote both with a hard-coded `limit=1000, offset=0` on every filtered export, so all three surfaces (MCP tool, `GET /api/export/jobs`, and the service itself) advertised pagination parameters that did nothing: paging through a 2,256-job set returned the same first 1,000 rows twelve times, and any export of a set larger than 1,000 was silently truncated with no indication that rows were missing. Callers that relied on the old behaviour of always receiving the first 1,000 rows now receive the page they actually asked for.

### Added

- `limit=0` on an export means "every row matching the filter", resolved against the set's real total instead of a fixed ceiling, so a full export no longer has to guess a large enough limit.
- Exports report the filtered set's `total` next to `row_count`: in the MCP CSV payload, in `JobExportResult`, and as the `X-Job-Search-Export-Total` response header. A truncated first page is now detectable by the caller rather than indistinguishable from a complete export.

### Changed

- `GET /api/export/jobs` no longer caps `limit` at 1000, since the cap silently bounded what an export could return.
- Raised the `cryptography` security floor to 50.0.0 for PYSEC-2026-3552, which was published after the previous release and broke the CI audit.

## [10.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Stopped the web process from writing directly to the Chroma vector store. ChromaDB's local `PersistentClient` is not safe for concurrent multi-process writes; the `web` and `scheduler` containers sharing one on-disk Chroma index corrupted its HNSW capacity bookkeeping and crashed the scheduler with a native segfault (`Index with capacity N and N current entries cannot add 1 records`). The scheduler process is now the sole writer — it prunes stale embeddings on a new periodic job (`vector_search.sync_interval_minutes`, default 30) instead of the web process deleting them inline.
- Raised security floors for 6 vulnerable transitive dependencies (cryptography, idna, pydantic-settings, pyjwt, python-multipart, starlette) so `pip-audit` reports no known vulnerabilities.
- `logging.timezone` now actually shapes log timestamps (it was parsed and documented but silently ignored), and an invalid timezone is rejected at config load.
- The Docker healthcheck no longer requires an obsolete `results/` directory that nothing creates, so a fresh volume no longer reports unhealthy.

### Removed

- Deleted the dead `exporter.py` module (and its `openpyxl` dependency); the live export path streams CSV/JSON to the browser in-memory.

### Changed

- The frontend is now linted (ESLint), formatted (Prettier), and exercised in CI — the vitest suite, typecheck, and build run on every push and PR instead of only inside a PR-only Docker build.
- Cleared all `npm audit` advisories and dropped the unused `@tanstack/react-table` dependency.
- CI runs with least-privilege `permissions: contents: read`, and the Docker build/smoke job now runs on push to `main` as well as PRs.
- Deprecation warnings are surfaced as test failures, and mypy/ruff configuration is single-sourced in `pyproject.toml`.

## [10.1.3] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Replaced ChromaDB's product telemetry implementation with a local no-op adapter so disabled telemetry no longer constructs PostHog or emits `capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given` log noise.
- Updated Docker telemetry defaults to point ChromaDB at the same no-op adapter used by the application.

## [10.1.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Kept semantic-search embeddings in sync when active jobs are deleted, blacklisted, or removed by cleanup so stale Chroma rows cannot resurface removed jobs.
- Made semantic search tolerate missing vector metadata and enrich active results from the job database across REST and MCP.

## [10.1.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Updated GitHub Actions Docker and artifact actions to Node 24-ready major versions, removing the Node.js 20 deprecation warning path before GitHub's forced runtime switch.

## [10.1.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- URL-backed dashboard navigation with shared page headers, visible alert banners, and an error boundary around each workspace.
- Jobs workspace controls for page size, CSV/JSON export format, posted/first-seen/last-seen date ranges, semantic search, row-level blacklist, row-level permanent delete, and detail-panel deletion.
- Blacklist workspace filters for text, company, location, blacklist age, and server-side pagination.
- Analytics metrics for new jobs today and blacklisted jobs.
- MCP `search_similar` support for `min_score` and `site`, returning the same location/site/job URL metadata exposed by REST.
- MCP `export_jobs` support for the same filtered query surface used by the dashboard and REST export endpoint.

### Changed

- Consolidated Jobs, Saved, and Applied into one Jobs workspace with status filtering instead of three duplicated dashboard pages.
- Split the Jobs dashboard into focused filter, action bar, table, detail, display, and query-mapping modules.
- Improved the Jobs table desktop and mobile layouts, including mobile row actions without page-level horizontal overflow.
- Refined the Jobs filter panel into a compact primary bar with grouped advanced filters and shorter score badges.
- Blacklist, Cleanup, and Analytics now use the same header, alert, confirmation, and command feedback patterns as the Jobs workspace.

### Fixed

- Dashboard now clears stale stored API tokens after REST 401/403 responses and returns to the token gate.
- Destructive dashboard commands now require confirmation before deleting, blacklisting, or purging records.
- Cleanup and blacklist numeric inputs now reject invalid manual command values instead of sending `NaN`-style requests.
- Dashboard error states are now visible for jobs, blacklist, cleanup, and analytics query or mutation failures.
- Dashboard no longer overflows horizontally on 390px mobile viewports.
- Dashboard export tests no longer emit jsdom navigation warnings.

## [10.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Breaking Changes

- MCP `list_jobs` now returns a paginated object with `items`, `total`, `limit`, and `offset` instead of a bare list, matching the REST/dashboard contract.
- MCP `set_bookmarked` and `set_applied` now take `job_ids` lists so single and bulk state changes use one command shape.

### Added

- Server-backed dashboard filters for location, company, multi-site, job type, salary bounds, posted-date bounds, and sort by score, date, company, title, or salary.
- First-class permanent delete, blacklist, unblacklist, facets, manual cleanup, and export capabilities in the shared application service.
- REST endpoints for facets, bulk bookmark/apply/delete, blacklist list/remove/purge, filtered or selected job export, and manual cleanup commands.
- MCP tools for blacklist management, facets, permanent delete, manual cleanup, and export, aligned with REST command names.
- Dashboard workspaces for Jobs, Saved, Applied, Blacklist, Cleanup, and Analytics.
- Blacklist dashboard with search, selection, unblacklist, and purge workflows.
- Cleanup dashboard with configured cleanup preview plus explicit manual delete-below-score, delete-stale, and purge-aged-blacklist commands.
- Docker smoke script that builds the image, starts the unified web server with seeded jobs, and verifies REST, dashboard serving, export, and MCP initialize/list-tools/call-tools.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the job triage dashboard around a denser operations-console layout with advanced filters, bulk actions, export selected/export filtered, and a richer job inspector.
- Dashboard API client now serializes array filters as repeated query parameters and uses the new bulk REST endpoints.
- Analytics now includes facet summaries for sources, companies, locations, and job types.
- Active-job delete and blacklist are clearly separated across dashboard, REST, MCP, and application service behavior.

### Removed

- The old dashboard `Database` view was replaced by the dedicated `Cleanup` workspace.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Dashboard token gate for local/LAN deployments that set `JOB_SEARCH_API_TOKEN`.
- Public `/api/dashboard/auth` route so the frontend can detect whether a token is required without exposing the token.
- Server-side pagination in the jobs dashboard, keeping large databases responsive.

### Changed

- Migrated dashboard styling to Tailwind CSS and HeroUI components, reducing custom UI code.
- Dashboard mutations now refresh jobs, stats, score distribution, and cleanup preview together.
- Dashboard job detail state now clears or syncs when filters, pagination, or refreshed data change.
- Browser CORS now defaults to localhost origins and uses `JOB_SEARCH_WEB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for explicit LAN or remote frontend origins.

### Fixed

- The dashboard now works when REST API token authentication is enabled.
- Open-job filtering now excludes both saved and applied jobs.
- Virtualized job rows are explicitly anchored for stable browser layout.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Breaking Changes

- The web runtime is now a single ASGI process. `job-search dashboard`,
  `job-search-api`, and `job-search-mcp` have been removed. Use
  `job-search-web`.
- Docker Compose now has two services only: `scheduler` and `web`. API and MCP
  are no longer separate Compose profiles.
- REST routes moved under `http://127.0.0.1:8501/api`; MCP moved to
  `http://127.0.0.1:8501/mcp`.
- `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_*`, `JOB_SEARCH_API_BIND`, `JOB_SEARCH_API_PORT`,
  `JOB_SEARCH_MCP_BIND`, and `JOB_SEARCH_MCP_PORT` have been removed. Use
  `JOB_SEARCH_WEB_BIND` and `JOB_SEARCH_WEB_PORT`. `JOB_SEARCH_API_TOKEN`
  remains supported for REST routes.
- The runtime no longer depends on or ships Streamlit. The dashboard is a React
  application built into the Docker image.

### Added

- React dashboard with job filtering, virtualized table rendering, detail
  panel, explicit bookmark/apply actions, bulk blacklisting, CSV export,
  analytics, and cleanup controls.
- Unified FastAPI web server (`job-search-web`) serving the dashboard, REST API,
  MCP streamable HTTP endpoint, and health check from one process.
- Shared application command/query layer used by REST, MCP, and dashboard flows.
- Documentation drift tests that fail when current docs advertise removed
  runtime commands or environment variables.

### Changed

- Docker image builds frontend assets in a dedicated Node stage and serves the
  built dashboard from the Python runtime image.
- CI Docker smoke tests now validate the unified web server through `/health`,
  `/api/jobs`, and `/`.
- User and developer documentation now describes the two-process runtime:
  scheduler plus unified web server.

### Removed

- Streamlit dashboard module and tests.
- Standalone REST API and MCP entrypoints.
- Obsolete current-system audit docs and internal release planning artifacts
  from the shipped documentation tree.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Breaking Changes

- Docker images no longer ship root-level command wrappers for `python main.py`,
  `python api_server.py`, `python mcp_server.py`, or `python healthcheck.py`.
  Use the installed entrypoints: `job-search`, `job-search-api`,
  `job-search-mcp`, and `job-search-healthcheck`.
- MCP now exposes streamable HTTP only at `/mcp`. The SSE and dual-transport
  compatibility modes, plus `JOB_SEARCH_MCP_TRANSPORT`, have been removed.
- Unsupported settings keys now fail startup instead of being accepted or
  ignored. Remove old keys such as `scheduler.enabled`, `scoring.threshold`,
  `database.cleanup_enabled`, `database.cleanup_days`,
  `vector_search.model_name`, and `vector_search.persist_dir`.
- SQLite startup no longer migrates older database layouts or historical job ID
  formats. Version 8.0.0 uses the current schema as the baseline; replace
  non-current `jobs.db` files with a fresh database or a current-format backup.

### Added

- Optional REST API Bearer token via `JOB_SEARCH_API_TOKEN`.
- Generated settings reference helper used by MCP documentation, sourced from
  `config/settings.example.yaml`.
- Docker Compose validation tests covering service settings mounts, localhost
  port bindings, and dev-profile coverage.
- Canonical documentation tree under `docs/user/` and `docs/developer/`.
- Installable package entrypoints: `job-search`, `job-search-api`,
  `job-search-mcp`, and `job-search-healthcheck`.
- Packaged default settings template used by installed MCP/API helpers.

### Changed

- **MCP server transport**: runtime exposes streamable HTTP at `/mcp` on port
  3001.
- Configuration parsing is now strict and rejects unsupported keys to prevent
  stale settings drift.
- Docker Compose now binds dashboard, API, and MCP to `127.0.0.1` by default,
  with explicit `*_BIND=0.0.0.0` LAN opt-in.
- MCP Docker service now mounts the same `settings.yaml` as the scheduler,
  dashboard, and API.
- API version metadata now comes from project metadata instead of a hardcoded
  string.
- Runtime modules moved from the historical `scripts/` layout into the
  installable `src/job_search_tool` package.
- Docker and CI now execute installed entrypoints instead of source-file paths.
- README is now a concise landing page instead of duplicated developer
  reference material.

### Fixed

- MCP settings documentation no longer drifts from current configuration
  defaults.
- SQLite persistent connection access is serialized with a re-entrant lock for
  normal multi-surface local usage.
- Development Compose override now covers scheduler, dashboard, API, and MCP.
- `job-search dashboard` now execs the packaged `dashboard.py` file instead of
  a non-existent `job_search_tool.dashboard.py` path.

### Removed

- Root-level agent instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) and internal
  planning artifacts under `docs/superpowers/`; public docs now live under
  `docs/user/` and `docs/developer/`.
- `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`; `pyproject.toml` plus
  `uv.lock` are the dependency source of truth.
- The package-refactor roadmap, because the refactor is part of this release.
- Docker image compatibility wrappers under `docker/compat/`.
- MCP SSE/dual transport runtime code and environment configuration.
- Legacy config warning/cache code for settings keys that no longer exist.
- SQLite schema and job ID migration code, including the internal `app_meta`
  migration table.

## [7.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **110 new tests** (373 → 483), bringing overall coverage from 82% to 87%:
  - `test_job_service.py` (23 tests): direct unit tests for the shared service layer — DB/VS singleton lifecycle, record serialization, filtering, sorting.
  - `test_integration.py` (9 tests): end-to-end pipeline tests with real databases (no mocking) — score→partition→save→reconcile cycle, bookmark/applied SQL protection, API and MCP full workflows, config-change simulation.
  - `test_main.py` (+25 tests): `_prepare_runtime` rescore+reconcile ordering, `run_job_search` with real scoring against temp DBs, notification data construction, `_cmd_once`/`_cmd_scheduler` lifecycle.
  - `test_database.py` (+19 tests): `reset_all` escape hatch, `reconcile_with_config` combinations, score distribution bins, preview count accuracy, batch blacklist operations.
  - `test_dashboard.py` (+34 tests): pure helper coverage (`_escape_html_text`, `_score_badge_html`, `_format_salary`, `_short_num`, `_days_ago`, `_filtered_jobs_csv_bytes`).

### Fixed

- `healthcheck.py`: added missing `from __future__ import annotations` (consistency with all other modules).
- `CLAUDE.md`: added `test_dashboard.py` to the test tree (was omitted).
- API server version string aligned to 7.1.1 (was still 7.1.0).

### Coverage

| Module | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `main.py` | 58% | 89% |
| `job_service.py` | 75% | 99% |
| `database.py` | 82% | 90% |
| `dashboard.py` | 67% | 71% |
| **Overall** | **82%** | **87%** |

## [7.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Shared service layer** (`src/job_search_tool/job_service.py`): extracted DB/vector-store initialization, record serialization, job filtering, and sorting into a single module shared by the dashboard, REST API, and MCP server. All three frontends are now thin adapters over `job_service`, eliminating ~60 lines of duplicated logic and ensuring consistent behavior across surfaces.
- **`api_server.py`** and **`mcp_server.py`** refactored to import all data operations from `job_service` instead of reimplementing them locally. Pydantic models and endpoint/tool definitions remain in the adapters.
- **`dashboard.py`** now imports `record_to_dict` from `job_service` instead of maintaining its own copy.

### Fixed

- **MCP `_SETTINGS_DOCUMENTATION`**: `scoring.notify_threshold` default corrected from `0` to `20` (matched the actual `ScoringConfig` default).
- **MCP vector store init**: failures are now logged with a warning instead of being silently swallowed (`except Exception: pass` → proper logging via `job_service.get_vs()`).
- **API server version**: updated from hardcoded `"1.0.0"` to `"7.1.0"` to match the project version.
- **SQLite cross-thread crash**: `check_same_thread=False` added to `sqlite3.connect()` in `database.py` — FastAPI runs sync endpoints in a threadpool, so the connection must be shareable across threads. WAL mode already provides concurrency safety.
- **MCP server port**: `FastMCP` constructor now passes `host="0.0.0.0"` and `port=3001` explicitly. The default (`127.0.0.1:8000`) didn't match the `docker-compose.yml` mapping and wouldn't accept connections from outside the container.
- **CI workflow**: removed stale `AGENTS.md` entry from `paths-ignore` (file was deleted in v7.0.1).
- **README.md**: test count corrected from 375 to 373.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **REST API server** (`src/job_search_tool/api_server.py`, FastAPI on port 8502) — programmatic CRUD access to the job database for scripts, automations, and external tools. Endpoints: `GET /jobs` (paginated, filterable by score/site/company/bookmark/applied), `GET /jobs/{id}`, `GET /jobs/search/semantic` (ChromaDB vector search), `GET /stats`, `GET /distribution`, `POST /jobs/{id}/bookmark`, `POST /jobs/{id}/apply`, `DELETE /jobs/{id}`, `DELETE /jobs/below-score/{N}`, `GET /health`. Auto-generated OpenAPI docs at `/docs`.
- **MCP server** (`src/job_search_tool/mcp_server.py`, SSE transport on port 3001) — tools that let an LLM become a job search assistant. DB access tools: `list_jobs`, `get_job` (including full description for fit evaluation), `search_similar` (semantic search), `get_statistics`, `get_score_distribution`. Action tools: `bookmark_job`, `apply_job`, `delete_job`, `delete_jobs_below_score`. Knowledge tool: `get_settings_documentation` returns a comprehensive static reference (~3000 chars) of every `settings.yaml` section, field, type, default, and constraint — the MCP server does NOT read the user's actual settings file or profile; the user provides those in conversation and the LLM uses the tools + schema knowledge to advise.
- **Docker Compose profiles** for the new services: `api` and `mcp`. The existing `scheduler` and `dashboard` always start; the new services are opt-in via `docker compose --profile api --profile mcp up -d`. No change to the default UX.
- **Port override env vars**: `JOB_SEARCH_API_PORT` (default 8502) and `JOB_SEARCH_MCP_PORT` (default 3001), documented in `.env.example` alongside the existing `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_PORT`.
- **38 new tests** (20 API, 18 MCP) covering happy paths, error paths (404, 503, missing vector store), and toggle operations.

### Changed

- **`docker-compose.yml`** top comment updated to document all four services and the Compose profiles opt-in pattern.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** test tree updated to reflect the current test suite (removed stale `test_report_generator.py` and `test_analyze_jobs.py`, added `test_api_server.py` and `test_mcp_server.py`).

### Dependencies

- `fastapi >= 0.115.0, < 1.0.0`
- `uvicorn >= 0.34.0, < 1.0.0`
- `mcp[cli] >= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0`

### Architecture

The tool now has four surfaces over a single data layer:

| Service | Consumer | Protocol | Port | Profile |
|---------|----------|----------|------|---------|
| scheduler | (autonomous) | — | — | *(always on)* |
| dashboard | Human (browser) | Streamlit | 8501 | *(always on)* |
| api | Scripts, automations | REST/JSON | 8502 | `api` |
| mcp | Claude, LLMs | MCP/SSE | 3001 | `mcp` |

All four share the `jobsearch-data` Docker volume. SQLite WAL mode ensures concurrent readers don't block the scheduler's writes.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-16

Housekeeping release. No functional changes: v7.0.0 introduced the new scoring/retention/dashboard surface, this release finishes the job by removing the dead code and stale documentation that didn't get caught in the main refactor pass.

**-2235 lines, no new features, no config changes.** If you're already running v7.0.0, the upgrade is `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` with no `settings.yaml` edits required.

### Removed

- **`src/job_search_tool/report_generator.py`** and its test — dead code, only self-imported. Its Excel formatting helpers were already duplicated in `src/job_search_tool/exporter.py`.
- **`src/job_search_tool/analyze_jobs.py`** and its test — standalone CLI utility (ran via `python analyze_jobs.py` or `docker compose exec scheduler python analyze_jobs.py`) whose entire feature set is now covered by the dashboard's Database tab introduced in v7.0.0: company/location/keyword statistics are shown interactively, the score distribution is a live histogram, and filtering by company is a click on the main tab. Keeping a second implementation of the same thing on the CLI was just maintenance debt.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — stale duplicate of `CLAUDE.md` that still described the pre-v7 pipeline (`cleanup_old_jobs` per-iteration, `filter_relevant_jobs`, `save_results`, single `scoring.threshold`). It wasn't updated during the v7 refactor and had drifted ~15 documentation blocks away from reality. `CLAUDE.md` is now the single source of truth for developer documentation; if another agent tool needs its own file later, it can be recreated from `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`.github/workflows/publish-main.yml`** — manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`) Docker publish workflow that had never been triggered. `publish-release.yml` handles real releases (every `v*` tag, multi-arch, SBOM, provenance, semver tag tree); `publish-main.yml` was leftover pre-release infrastructure whose only effect on Docker Hub would have been a confusing `main` tag.
- **`SearchResult` dataclass** in `src/job_search_tool/models.py` — unused since before v7 and not to be confused with `vector_store.SemanticSearchResult` which is live.
- **`mock_logger` fixture** in `tests/conftest.py` — defined at the top-level conftest but with zero consumers; `test_logger.py` has its own locally-scoped fixture of the same name.
- **`results/.gitkeep`** and **`data/.gitkeep`** — both directories are gitignored and created lazily at runtime (the `results/` directory is only created the first time a user triggers an export from the dashboard's Database tab).

### Changed

- **`README.md`**: flow diagrams rewritten for `save_threshold` / `notify_threshold` partitioning, the "SAVE CSV/EXCEL" box in the pipeline diagram is gone, the "Optional Exports" section is rewritten around dashboard on-demand exports, `min_score_for_notification` is gone from the YAML example (replaced with a pointer to `scoring.notify_threshold`), the Docker Publishing subsection only mentions `publish-release.yml`, and the test count moves from 361 to 335.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: project tree no longer lists the removed modules; the "extracted to" note about `filter_relevant_jobs` / `save_results` now correctly reflects that one was split (into `score_jobs` + `partition_by_thresholds`) and the other was removed entirely; a new Dashboard section documents the Database tab's five subsections and the SQL-level bookmarked/applied protection invariant; the `SearchResult` stub is gone; test count updated.
- **`.dockerignore`**: dropped the `AGENTS.md` entry along with the file itself.

### Test plan

- `pytest`: 335 passed, 0 failed. The delta from v7.0.0 (375 tests) is exactly the sum of the deleted `test_report_generator.py` (15) + `test_analyze_jobs.py` (17) + 8 parameterized variants that lived inside them.
- `ruff check src/job_search_tool tests/` clean.
- `ruff format src/job_search_tool tests/` — no files reformatted.
- CI green on PR #8 before and after the release bump commit.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-15

This is a major release. The scoring pipeline, the database retention model, and the dashboard's database management surface have all been rebuilt around a single principle: **`settings.yaml` is the source of truth and the DB reconciles to it at every boot**. Breaking changes are intentional and there is no backwards-compatibility shim — migrating an old `settings.yaml` is a five-minute edit.

### Added

- **`scoring.save_threshold`** and **`scoring.notify_threshold`** — two independent thresholds that split the single `scoring.threshold` into "what enters the archive" (wide, default `0`) and "what triggers notifications and counts as relevant" (narrow, default `20`). The loader refuses configs where `notify_threshold < save_threshold`.
- **`database.retention`** block with `max_age_days` (default `30`) and `purge_blacklist_after_days` (default `90`). Applied at every boot by the new `reconcile_with_config` pass — no `cleanup_enabled` flag, no opt-in: if you don't want retention, raise the limits.
- **Reconciliation at boot** — after `recalculate_all_scores`, the tool now runs `db.reconcile_with_config(config)` which drops jobs below `save_threshold`, drops stale jobs, purges the blacklist, and syncs the vector store. Idempotent: running it twice in a row is a no-op. If anything was removed, a summary is pushed to Telegram (`🧹 Startup cleanup: X jobs removed`).
- **SQL-level protection invariant** — every DELETE query (except the explicit `reset_all` escape hatch) includes `AND bookmarked = 0 AND applied = 0`. Bookmarked and applied jobs are structurally immune to automatic cleanup, both at boot and from the dashboard's smart-cleanup controls. Not configurable.
- **Database retention primitives** in `src/job_search_tool/database.py`: `delete_jobs_below_score`, `delete_stale_jobs` (renamed from `cleanup_old_jobs`/`delete_jobs_older_than`), `purge_blacklist`, `get_score_distribution`, `count_jobs_below_score`, `count_stale_jobs`, `count_blacklist_older_than`, `reconcile_with_config`, `reset_all`. Dedicated SQL index on `relevance_score` so score-based cleanups stay O(log n).
- **New Database tab in the Streamlit dashboard** — a full management surface with five sections:
  - **Health**: total jobs, bookmarked, applied, blacklisted, average score, DB size on disk.
  - **Score distribution**: dynamic histogram from `get_score_distribution`, with vertical reference lines drawn at both `save_threshold` and `notify_threshold`.
  - **Smart cleanup**: four cards with live preview counts before confirmation — *Delete below score N* (default = current `save_threshold`), *Delete stale older than N days*, *Purge blacklist older than N days*, and **Apply `settings.yaml` retention now** which calls `reconcile_with_config` against the live config and shows the `ReconciliationReport` in the UI.
  - **Export**: on-demand CSV/Excel of the currently filtered view.
  - **Danger zone**: Full reset with text-confirmed `DELETE` that truncates the `jobs` table, the `deleted_jobs` blacklist, and the ChromaDB collection in one shot (the only path that bypasses the bookmarked/applied invariant).
- **`ReconcileNotificationData`** + `format_reconcile_message` + `NotificationManager.send_reconcile_sync` in `src/job_search_tool/notifier.py` for the startup cleanup summary.
- **`Partitions`** dataclass in `src/job_search_tool/scoring.py` — the new `partition_by_thresholds(scored, config)` returns a `Partitions(scored, to_save, to_notify)` so the main flow reads as score → partition → save → embed → notify without any threshold arithmetic at the call site.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`scoring.threshold` is gone**. Replace with `scoring.save_threshold` + `scoring.notify_threshold`. Old single-threshold configs are rejected — the loader does not translate them.
- **`scoring.notify_threshold >= scoring.save_threshold` is enforced** as a hard error at load time. Notifying about jobs you don't even archive is nonsensical, so the loader treats it as a config bug, not a warning.
- **`database.cleanup_enabled`, `database.cleanup_days`, and `database.recalculate_scores_on_startup` are gone**. Score recalculation at boot is always on (it's cheap and deterministic). Age-based cleanup is always on via `database.retention.max_age_days`. There is no longer a knob to turn either feature off — set `max_age_days` to something large if you want "never expire".
- **`output:` section removed entirely**. The search pipeline no longer writes `all_jobs_*.csv` or `relevant_jobs_*.csv` on every run. CSV and Excel exports are available exclusively from the dashboard's Database tab, triggered on demand. The `results/` directory is created lazily the first time an export happens.
- **`telegram.min_score_for_notification` removed**. The notify threshold is a relevance concept owned by the scoring engine (`scoring.notify_threshold`), not a Telegram channel setting. The partition of new jobs to notify about is computed upstream by `partition_by_thresholds`; the notifier just receives an already-filtered list.
- **`filter_relevant_jobs` is gone**. It has been split into `score_jobs(df, config)` (adds the `relevance_score` column) and `partition_by_thresholds(scored, config)` (returns the `Partitions` dataclass). Callers that used to pull the single "relevant" frame now pull `to_save` and `to_notify` independently.
- **`cleanup_old_jobs` / `delete_jobs_older_than`** → renamed to `delete_stale_jobs`. **`filter_blacklisted_jobs`** → renamed to `exclude_blacklisted`.
- **Main flow rewritten**. `_prepare_runtime` now runs `rescore_all` → `reconcile_with_config` → vector-store sync → optional Telegram reconcile summary at every boot, for both `scheduler` and `once` modes. `run_job_search` is `search → score → partition → exclude_blacklisted → save → embed → notify(to_notify)` with zero CSV side effects.

### Removed

- `OutputConfig` dataclass and the entire `scripts/exporter.save_results` code path. `src/job_search_tool/exporter.py` is reduced to a single `export_dataframe(df, output_dir, basename, fmt)` helper used only by the dashboard.
- Dead `main()` function in `src/job_search_tool/search_jobs.py` (it duplicated the pipeline; there was only one real entry point).
- Automatic `all_jobs_*.csv` and `relevant_jobs_*.csv` files from the results folder on every scheduled run.

### Migration

For an existing v6 `settings.yaml`, five edits:

1. In `scoring:`, replace `threshold: N` with:
   ```yaml
   save_threshold: 0
   notify_threshold: N
   ```
   Pick `save_threshold: 0` for a wide archive (recommended) or raise it if you want the DB to stay narrow.
2. In `database:`, delete `cleanup_enabled`, `cleanup_days`, and `recalculate_scores_on_startup`, and replace with:
   ```yaml
   retention:
     max_age_days: 30        # use your old cleanup_days value here
     purge_blacklist_after_days: 90
   ```
3. Delete the entire `output:` section.
4. In `notifications.telegram:`, delete `min_score_for_notification`. If you had it set to a non-zero value, copy that value to `scoring.notify_threshold` instead — that preserves your existing notification bar exactly.
5. Restart the tool. The first boot will rescore every existing job and run reconciliation; expect a one-off cleanup Telegram message if any of your stored jobs fall below the new `save_threshold`, are stale beyond `max_age_days`, or belong to a purged blacklist entry. Bookmarked and applied jobs are protected.

### Why

Before this release, `scoring.threshold` did triple duty: it decided what got saved, what got exported, and what counted as "relevant" for notifications. That meant the dashboard could only ever show jobs that had already passed the single narrow filter — there was no room for exploration, no way to investigate borderline matches, and tuning the keywords meant permanently losing the jobs scored under the old pesi. On top of that, retention was a per-iteration age-based sweep that would happily delete a job you had just bookmarked.

The split fixes all of that in one pass. `save_threshold` makes the DB an archive you can actually browse; `notify_threshold` keeps Telegram focused on the jobs worth waking up for; reconciliation makes `settings.yaml` dichiarativo (edit the file, restart, the DB catches up); and the SQL-level bookmark/applied protection turns the dashboard's cleanup tools into something you can click confidently.

### Test plan

- 375 tests pass, 0 failures (+14 over the v6.0.8 baseline of 361). New coverage: `reconcile_with_config` idempotency, SQL-level bookmark/applied protection across every retention primitive, cross-section validation of `notify_threshold >= save_threshold`, `Partitions` carving, dashboard smart-cleanup preview counts, `ReconcileNotificationData` formatting.
- `ruff check` and `ruff format` both clean across `scripts/` and `tests/`.
- CI fully green on PR #7 (test 3.11, test 3.12, quality, security, docker).
- The Docker healthcheck step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now bind-mounts `config/settings.example.yaml` into `/data/config/settings.yaml` so `healthcheck.py` runs end-to-end against a real config through the entrypoint's boot guard — a pre-existing CI bug from v6.0.1 is also fixed as part of this release.

## [6.0.8] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Hybrid volume layout** is now the canonical setup. `settings.yaml` lives on the host as a read-only file bind-mounted directly into each container at `/data/config/settings.yaml`; everything else (SQLite database, ChromaDB vector store, CSV/Excel exports, logs) stays in the Docker-managed named volume `jobsearch-data`. This replaces the v6.0.6/v6.0.7 "inject via `docker run alpine`" workflow which forced users through a one-shot helper container just to write a single file.
- **User-facing workflow collapses to three steps**: drop `settings.yaml` next to `docker-compose.yml`, drop the compose file, `docker compose up -d`. Updates are `vim settings.yaml && docker compose restart scheduler`. No `docker compose cp`, no `docker run alpine`, no `docker volume create` pre-step.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: both services gain a second volume entry — `./settings.yaml:/data/config/settings.yaml:ro` — alongside the existing `jobsearch-data:/data` named volume. The named volume definition still uses `name: jobsearch-data` so the volume's real name is not prefixed by the Compose project.
- **`README.md` Quick Start rewritten** for the three-step flow. The "Bare `docker run` (no Compose)" section is simplified to match (the old step 2 "inject via alpine" is gone — a single `-v "$PWD/settings.yaml:..."` mount replaces it on each `docker run` invocation). The Data Storage section now has a two-row table that makes the split between the host-side config and the Docker-managed state explicit.
- **`docker/entrypoint.sh`**: the existing "missing settings.yaml" error path now also detects the common pitfall where Docker Compose auto-creates `./settings.yaml` as a directory (because the host file didn't exist at the time of the first `up`) and emits a targeted `rm -rf ./settings.yaml` recovery hint for that specific case.

### Why

`settings.yaml` is the only artefact the user ever wants to *edit*; the rest is state the tool manages. Keeping the config on the host as a plain file gives you editor-friendly workflows (`vim`, `nano`, `code`, diff against git, back up with `cp`) while the Docker-managed volume takes care of the non-trivial state with zero permission friction — no host-side `chown`, no UID/GID env vars, no `gosu`, no privileged init. It's the same split the official `postgres` image makes between `postgresql.conf` and `PGDATA`.

No code changes — the entrypoint refactor is purely the error-message extension. 361 tests still green.

## [6.0.7] - 2026-04-15

### Documentation

Full-repo coherence audit after the v4.4.0 → v6.0.6 release sprint. All of the following stale references that contradicted the v6.0.6 mandatory-config contract have been corrected:

- **`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`**: project-tree comments on `settings.example.yaml` and `entrypoint.sh` no longer claim first-run auto-scaffolding; the "Execution Modes" table is rewritten to reflect the CLI subcommand-driven contract (no `scheduler.enabled` flag); the `main()` docstring matches the actual subcommand dispatch; total test count updated from `~324` to the real `361`.
- **`README.md`**: Quick Start and Bare-`docker run` sections carry the new mandatory settings.yaml flow end-to-end (no auto-scaffold wording anywhere); project-structure listing describes `settings.example.yaml` as "never copied into the user's volume" and `entrypoint.sh` as "requires user-supplied settings.yaml"; Test count bumps from `355+` / `350+` to `361`; the ASCII execution-flow diagram labels modes with `main.py once` / `main.py scheduler` instead of the removed `scheduler: true/false` flag; `docker compose cp` examples use the Compose service name (`scheduler`) instead of container names; Upgrade Troubleshooting section reframed around "refresh settings.yaml" (no "first-run scaffolding" recipe).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: the `cp config/settings.example.yaml config/settings.yaml` step is now explicitly scoped to local Python development, with an inline note that the Docker runtime requires injection into the named volume instead.

No code or Docker-image changes — the v6.0.6 and v6.0.7 images are functionally equivalent. Published Docker tags are refreshed so anyone pulling `:latest` at the new version reads the updated in-image docs and `settings.example.yaml` metadata.

## [6.0.6] - 2026-04-15

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`settings.yaml` is now strictly required** — no default, no fallback, no auto-scaffolding. The entrypoint refuses to start either service if `/data/config/settings.yaml` is missing, exits with a clear actionable error message, and lets Docker's restart policy do the rest. `config/settings.example.yaml` remains a **documentation artefact**: it ships with the repo and inside the image purely to show the expected shape of a valid configuration, and is never copied into the user's data volume automatically.
- **`docker/entrypoint.sh` rewritten**: it creates the `/data/{config,db,chroma,results,logs}` subtree on every start, then requires `settings.yaml` to exist. The previous first-run "scaffold from template" behaviour from v6.0.0 is gone — it encouraged users to boot with generic placeholder queries and "Your Name" profile strings, which was never the intended UX.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: volume declaration now uses `name: jobsearch-data` so Compose doesn't prefix it with the project name. This lets `docker volume create jobsearch-data` (used to pre-seed `settings.yaml`) and the Compose-managed volume reference the same underlying Docker volume.

### Quick Start (new mandatory-config flow)

```bash
# 1. Grab the documented template
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat \
  vincenzoimp/job-search-tool:latest \
  /opt/job-search-tool/defaults/settings.example.yaml > settings.yaml

# 2. Edit settings.yaml with your queries, scoring, and (optional) Telegram bot

# 3. Inject it into the named volume
docker volume create jobsearch-data
docker run --rm \
  -v jobsearch-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD/settings.yaml:/src.yaml:ro" \
  alpine sh -c 'mkdir -p /data/config && cp /src.yaml /data/config/settings.yaml'

# 4. Start the stack
docker compose up -d
```

Four explicit steps, zero magic. If you forget step 3 the containers fail loudly with an error message that tells you exactly what to do.

### Migration notes

- If you were relying on v6.0.5's auto-scaffolded default `settings.yaml` (generic Remote software-engineer queries, no Telegram), copy it out first with `docker compose cp` before upgrading, or use the new flow to inject your own.
- The `settings.example.yaml` file is no longer written to the volume by the container. Your existing `settings.example.yaml` inside the volume from older releases is harmless and can be deleted: `docker run --rm -v jobsearch-data:/data alpine rm /data/config/settings.example.yaml`.

## [6.0.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **ChromaDB telemetry errors are actually silenced now**: v6.0.3 tried to disable them via the `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False` env var but the posthog client bundled with our ChromaDB pin ignores that variable and still fires `Failed to send telemetry event … capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given` on every client call. `src/job_search_tool/vector_store.py` now passes `Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)` directly to `chromadb.PersistentClient`, which the library honours end-to-end.
- **JobSpy log dedupe actually deduplicates**: v6.0.4 installed the right `DedupeFilter` on the root logger, but JobSpy attaches its *own* StreamHandler to each per-site logger (`JobSpy:Indeed`, `JobSpy:Glassdoor`, ...) at import time, bypassing the root filter entirely. `src/job_search_tool/logger.py` now strips those handlers during `setup_logging` and forces `propagate=True` so every JobSpy record flows through the root handler where the dedupe filter lives. Third-party noise is now collapsed per `(name, level, message)` tuple in practice, not just in theory.
- **Legacy-key deprecation warnings are one-shot**: `scheduler.enabled is ignored in v6+` used to fire twice per scheduler iteration (once during startup `load_config()`, once during `reload_config()` inside `run_job_search()`). They're now tracked in a per-process `_LEGACY_WARNED` set in `src/job_search_tool/config.py` and emitted exactly once regardless of how many times the parser runs. Applies to `output.*`, `scheduler.enabled`, and `vector_search.{model_name,persist_dir}` legacy keys alike.

### Changed

- **`src/job_search_tool/logger.py`**: new `_reroute_jobspy_loggers()` helper invoked by `setup_logging`. Pre-configures the nine known JobSpy per-site loggers (strip handlers, `propagate=True`, level `WARNING`) so they inherit the root handler's `DedupeFilter` and the uniform log format.
- **`src/job_search_tool/config.py`**: new `_warn_legacy_once(section, message)` helper backed by a module-level set. Replaces the three ad-hoc `logger.warning(...)` call sites with a single one-shot implementation. Autouse pytest fixture in `conftest.py` snapshots and restores the set between tests so cross-test state leakage can't re-trigger warnings.

### Added

- **README Troubleshooting**: new "Upgrading within v6.x leaves stale settings in the named volume" section explaining why the `jobsearch-data` volume persists across upgrades and giving two reset recipes (nuclear `down -v` vs surgical `docker compose cp`).
- **Tests**: `test_legacy_enabled_key_warns_only_once`, `TestRerouteJobSpyLoggers.test_strips_existing_handlers_and_forces_propagation`, and `TestRerouteJobSpyLoggers.test_setup_logging_dedupes_duplicate_jobspy_records` — all three regressions discovered in v6.0.4 are now covered.

## [6.0.4] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Cleaner Compose defaults**: the committed `docker-compose.yml` now uses project name `jobsearch`, named containers `jobsearch-scheduler` / `jobsearch-dashboard`, and network `jobsearch`. `docker ps` and `docker compose logs -f <service>` read cleanly without the `-<n>` replica suffix.
- **Network hardening baked into the default stack**:
  - `networks.default.enable_ipv6: false` prevents the class of `[Errno 113] No route to host` errors seen on hosts with broken dual-stack routing (LXC, home routers with half-configured IPv6, cloud VMs without a default v6 route). Python's `getaddrinfo` only returns IPv4 results inside the stack.
  - Explicit `dns: [1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8]` on both services bypasses the embedded Docker DNS → host DNS chain that occasionally returns stale or unreachable upstream IPs.
- **Safer first-run template** (`config/settings.example.yaml`): default `sites` narrowed to `[indeed, linkedin]` (Glassdoor is opt-in because its API rejects many common location formats with HTTP 400 / `location not parsed`); default `locations` changed to `["Remote"]` with `is_remote: true` so a brand-new container runs clean without region-specific parsing quirks.

### Fixed

- **JobSpy log noise deduplicated**: replaced the broken `logging.getLogger("jobspy").setLevel(CRITICAL)` (which targeted a non-existent lowercase logger name) with a proper `DedupeFilter` attached to both our application handlers and a root-logger handler. Third-party loggers like `JobSpy:Glassdoor` used to fire the same `Glassdoor: location not parsed` error 24+ times per run; now only the first occurrence is emitted per `(logger_name, level, message)` tuple. The filter is generic and will also collapse repeated noise from other chatty libraries.
- **`job_search` logger no longer propagates**: application logs are now emitted only by our own handlers, preventing double-logging through the root handler we install for third-party capture.

### Added

- **README `Troubleshooting` section** rewritten with four actionable scenarios: rate limiting, Glassdoor `location not parsed`, `No route to host` / IPv6 diagnosis, and the local rebuild workflow. Includes a copy-pasteable `docker compose exec` diagnostic for network reachability.
- **`DedupeFilter` unit tests**: six regression tests covering first-occurrence pass, duplicate suppression, distinct messages, independent logger tracking, prefix scoping, and global dedupe.

## [6.0.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Scheduler never actually ran continuously** after v6.0.0: `JobSearchScheduler.start()` still consulted the legacy `config.scheduler.enabled` flag, and the bundled `settings.example.yaml` shipped with `scheduler.enabled: false` as the default. First-run containers happily scaffolded their settings, logged `"Scheduler disabled, running once and exiting"`, completed one search, and then died — losing the entire "unless-stopped continuous loop" promise of v6. The CLI subcommand (`python main.py scheduler`) now fully owns the mode selection and always runs the continuous loop.
- **ChromaDB telemetry noise**: silenced the `Failed to send telemetry event … capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given` errors from ChromaDB's bundled posthog client via `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False` and `CHROMA_TELEMETRY_IMPL=none` environment variables baked into the image.

### Changed

- **`SchedulerConfig.enabled` removed**: the continuous/single-shot choice is expressed by the CLI subcommand alone. `settings.yaml` keys with `scheduler.enabled` are now ignored with a one-line deprecation warning.
- **`src/job_search_tool/scheduler.py`**: `start()` unconditionally enters the continuous loop; the `_execute_job` retry-scheduling branches no longer double-check `config.scheduler.enabled` (they rely on the `self._scheduler` presence alone, which is already the canonical marker of continuous mode).
- **`config/settings.example.yaml`**: scheduler section is rewritten to document that the mode is chosen by the CLI and no longer exposes `enabled`.
- **Test suite**: `test_start_disabled_scheduler_runs_once` removed (the fallback it covered no longer exists); fixtures updated to construct `SchedulerConfig()` with defaults.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **First-run permission error on non-root containers**: the default `docker-compose.yml` now uses a Docker-managed named volume (`jobsearch-data`) instead of a `./data` host bind mount. On hosts where Docker creates `./data` as `root:root` (the common case when the Docker daemon itself runs as root — e.g. alpine-docker without userns-remap), the non-root container (`appuser`, UID 1000) would fail to write with `mkdir: cannot create directory '/data/config': Permission denied`. Named volumes inherit their ownership from the image, so the container writes to them without any host-side preparation.

### Changed

- **`docker-compose.yml`** switches from `./data:/data` bind mount to `jobsearch-data:/data` named volume. Both services still share the same volume, still run as `appuser`, still auto-scaffold `settings.yaml` on first boot.
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml`** follows the same pattern for the local-build override.
- **README Quick Start** updated: new compose snippet, `docker compose cp` workflow for editing `settings.yaml`, documented `docker run --rm -v jobsearch-data:/data alpine tar …` backup/restore recipe (the canonical Docker named-volume backup pattern).
- Standalone `docker run` examples in the README now create and reuse a named volume (`docker volume create jobsearch-data`) instead of mounting host paths.
- `.gitignore` excludes the whole `data/` directory tree so local dev state under the repo root never accidentally ends up in a commit.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Single Docker image**: the dashboard/core variant split from v5.0.0 is removed. One image tree, one tag family (`:latest`, `:vX.Y.Z`, `:vX.Y`, `:vX`, `:sha-<commit>`). Both Compose services pull the same image — Docker downloads it once and shares layers — and differ only by the command they run.
- **Unified CLI subcommands**: `src/job_search_tool/main.py` now accepts subcommands:
  - `python main.py` / `python main.py scheduler` — continuous scheduler loop (default)
  - `python main.py once` — single-shot run (for cron / CI)
  - `python main.py dashboard` — `exec`-replaces the process with Streamlit on port 8501
  Replaces the v6.0.0 transient `--once` flag.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** uses explicit `command: ["python", "main.py", <subcommand>]` on both services.
- **Streamlit moved back to main dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`; the `[project.optional-dependencies] dashboard` extra is removed.
- **Dockerfile** simplified to a single target: no more `ARG VARIANT`, no more `builder-core` / `builder-dashboard` / `builder-final` stages.
- **CI + publish workflows** drop the `[dashboard, core]` matrix and build once per run.
- **README Quick Start** fixes a copy-paste bug from v6.0.0 where the dashboard service was missing a `command:` override and would have silently run a second scheduler instead of Streamlit.

### Removed

- Docker image tag families `:latest-core`, `:vX.Y.Z-core`, `:core`, `:sha-<commit>-core`.
- `--build-arg VARIANT` on the Dockerfile.
- `[project.optional-dependencies] dashboard` in `pyproject.toml`.
- CI matrix build of two variants in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `publish-release.yml`, `publish-main.yml`.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **Minimal two-service Compose stack**: `docker-compose.yml` collapses to two flat services — `scheduler` on `:latest-core` and `dashboard` on `:latest` — sharing a single `./data:/data` volume. YAML anchors, profiles, `init-config`, `jobsearch`, and `analyze` services are gone. `docker compose up -d` now starts the continuous scheduler and the dashboard together out of the box.
- **Single `/data` volume**: every persistent file now lives under one mount point with a fixed layout — `/data/config/settings.yaml`, `/data/db/jobs.db`, `/data/chroma/`, `/data/results/`, `/data/logs/search.log`. Users go from four bind mounts (`config/`, `data/`, `results/`, `logs/`) to **one**. Override the root with `JOB_SEARCH_DATA_DIR`.
- **First-run auto-bootstrap**: on startup, the container creates `/data/config/settings.yaml` from the bundled template if it is missing, scaffolds the `/data/{config,db,chroma,results,logs}` subtree, and logs a clear "edit me and restart" hint. The `init-config` service and `src/job_search_tool/bootstrap_config.py` helper are removed — both obsolete.
- **Scheduler is the default mode**: `python main.py` now starts the continuous APScheduler loop by default. Use `python main.py --once` for a one-off single-shot run (cron, CI). The `JOB_SEARCH_MODE=single|scheduled` env variable is gone.
- **Fixed persistent paths**: `output.results_dir`, `output.data_dir`, `output.database_file`, `logging.file`, `vector_search.model_name`, and `vector_search.persist_dir` are removed from `settings.yaml`. They are silently accepted with a one-line warning to ease the transition. Use `JOB_SEARCH_DATA_DIR` to relocate the whole tree.
- **Dockerfile runs under `tini`** for clean SIGTERM propagation, declares `VOLUME /data`, and exports `JOB_SEARCH_DATA_DIR=/data` as a default env.
- **`.env.example` slimmed down**: dropped `JOB_SEARCH_IMAGE` / `JOB_SEARCH_CORE_IMAGE` / `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_IMAGE`, kept only the Telegram token, UID/GID, and dashboard port.
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml` rewritten**: rebuilds both variants (`core` and `dashboard`) from the local checkout via `--build-arg VARIANT=...`.

### Removed

- `src/job_search_tool/bootstrap_config.py` and its tests — the entrypoint does the bootstrap inline.
- Compose services: `init-config`, `jobsearch`, `analyze`, all profile-gated services. Use `docker compose exec scheduler python analyze_jobs.py` for ad-hoc analysis.
- `scripts/main.py::_resolve_scheduled_mode` and the `JOB_SEARCH_MODE` env switch.
- `OutputConfig.results_dir` / `.data_dir` / `.database_file`, `LoggingConfig.file`, `VectorSearchConfig.model_name` / `.persist_dir`.
- `get_vector_store(persist_dir, model_name=...)` signature — the `model_name` parameter is gone (it was already a no-op since v4.4.0).

## [5.0.1] - 2026-04-15

### Documentation

- **Sync stale references** to match the v5.0.0 variant split and v4.4.0 ONNX embedder migration:
  - `README.md`: feature tables, ASCII execution-flow diagram, Docker Publishing section rewritten for the core/dashboard matrix, `docker run` examples updated to prefer `:latest-core` for headless usage, Acknowledgments cleaned of the removed `sentence-transformers` entry, test count refreshed.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: dashboard launch command no longer references the removed `--profile dashboard`.
  - `.env.example`: replaces `JOB_SEARCH_IMAGE` with `JOB_SEARCH_CORE_IMAGE` and `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_IMAGE`.
  - `config/settings.example.yaml`: `vector_search` block now documents that `model_name` is ignored and describes the ONNX embedder.
  - `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`: tech stack table, project tree comment on `Dockerfile`, internal changelog (v4.4.0 + v5.0.0 entries added), "Last Updated" date refreshed. `AGENTS.md` is now tracked alongside `CLAUDE.md`.
  - `src/job_search_tool/dashboard.py`: "semantic search unavailable" hint no longer mentions the removed `sentence-transformers` package.

No functional or Docker-image changes — the v5.0.0 and v5.0.1 images are byte-for-byte equivalent aside from the `VERSION` build label.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **Two Docker image variants**: The project now publishes two variants from the same tag family:
  - `vincenzoimp/job-search-tool:X.Y.Z` (default, dashboard) — full stack with Streamlit UI, behaves like previous `:latest`.
  - `vincenzoimp/job-search-tool:X.Y.Z-core` — slim image, Streamlit removed (~200 MB smaller).
- **Dockerfile rewritten as variant-aware**: Single parameterized `runtime` stage, variant chosen at build time via `--build-arg VARIANT=core|dashboard` (default: `dashboard`). Replaces the previous single-target build.
- **`docker-compose.yml` wires each service to the right image**: `jobsearch`, `scheduler`, `analyze`, `init-config` → core image (`${JOB_SEARCH_CORE_IMAGE:-vincenzoimp/job-search-tool:latest-core}`); `dashboard` → dashboard image (`${JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_IMAGE:-vincenzoimp/job-search-tool:latest}`). Headless services automatically benefit from the slim image without user intervention.
- **Dashboard runs by default**: `docker compose up` now starts `jobsearch` + `dashboard` out of the box. The `dashboard` profile has been removed (no longer needed). Old usage `docker compose --profile dashboard up dashboard` becomes `docker compose up dashboard`.
- **`JOB_SEARCH_IMAGE` env var removed**: Replaced by `JOB_SEARCH_CORE_IMAGE` and `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_IMAGE`. Users overriding the image via environment variable must update their setup.
- **`streamlit` moved to optional dependency** `[project.optional-dependencies] dashboard` in `pyproject.toml`. Local `uv sync` (with default dev group) still installs it for test suites; production core builds do not.
- **Pruned `.venv`** in builder stage: removes `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyi`, and bundled `tests/` directories from installed packages before the runtime copy. Saves ~50–100 MB on both image variants.
- **CI Docker smoke job** now builds both variants in a matrix and runs the healthcheck on each, so regressions in either build path are caught on PRs.

### Migration notes

- **`:latest` still works and still ships Streamlit** — no change for users pulling the default tag for a dashboard deployment.
- If you override the compose image via `JOB_SEARCH_IMAGE`, replace it with `JOB_SEARCH_CORE_IMAGE` (and optionally `JOB_SEARCH_DASHBOARD_IMAGE` for the dashboard service).
- If you had scripts doing `docker compose --profile dashboard up`, drop the flag — the dashboard is now a default service.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Lightweight Vector Search**: `JobVectorStore` now uses ChromaDB's built-in `DefaultEmbeddingFunction` (onnxruntime + bundled `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) instead of `sentence-transformers`. Same embedding model, same search quality, no torch runtime.
- **Dependency Slimdown**: Removed `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, and `transformers` from runtime dependencies. Docker image size drops by roughly 2.5–3 GB (the previous lock also pulled the full CUDA stack — `nvidia-cublas`, `cudnn`, `nccl`, `triton`, etc. — despite `UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cpu`).
- **Dockerfile**: Removed the now-unused `UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cpu` build arg.

### Deprecated

- `vector_search.model_name` is now ignored — the store always uses the model bundled with ChromaDB's default embedder. A warning is logged if a non-default value is configured. The setting is retained for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future release.

## [4.3.2] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Release Workflow Simplification**: Docker images now publish automatically from version tags only, while `publish-main.yml` is now a manual maintainer workflow and CI keeps the Docker smoke build on pull requests instead of every push to `main`
- **Release Documentation Alignment**: Updated the README and changelog so the documented release flow matches the actual GitHub Actions behavior

## [4.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **CI Pipeline Efficiency**: Split formatting/type checks out of the Python-version matrix, keep coverage on Python 3.11 only, skip docs-only runs, and cancel superseded in-flight CI runs
- **Docker CI Validation**: The Docker job now bootstraps a real config and runs the health check for the built image instead of masking failures

### Fixed

- **Dashboard CSV Safety**: Filtered dashboard CSV exports now reuse the shared spreadsheet sanitization path, preventing formula-injection regressions
- **Logger Handler Lifecycle**: Repeated logging setup now closes replaced handlers, avoiding file-descriptor leaks in long-lived scheduled runs
- **Telegram Delivery Reporting**: Notification success now reflects whether job chunks were actually delivered instead of treating partial failures as success
- **Stable Job IDs**: Internal job IDs now normalize trivial whitespace and Unicode spacing differences, and existing databases/blacklists are migrated automatically on startup
- **Dashboard Import Side Effects**: Importing `dashboard.py` no longer executes the Streamlit app outside `streamlit run`
